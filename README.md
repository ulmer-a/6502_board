# Homebrew 6502 computer

This repo contains schematics, netlist, layout and gerber plots for the pcb,
as well as a parts list and the firmware (basic features are working, but it's
still under development). All parts are new and readily available as of Dec '21.

## Specifications

* 65c02 8-bit CPU along with 32KB RAM and 8K ROM
* 65c22 VIA provides some GPIO pins and timers
* 65c51 ACIA provides a serial port with up to 115200 baud
* 4 status led's
* 18 pin I/O pinheader with general purpose I/O pins (VIA)
* 34 pin expansion pinheader exposing full address and data bus
as well as other interesting lines (`SYNC`, `CLK` and `HALT`)

## Firmware

The firmware is currently under development but already provides
`getchar()` and `putchar()` functions to nicely interact with any
device attached to the serial port. these are implemented fully
asynchronously.
